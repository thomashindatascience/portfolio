# An image classification competition to classify 5 millions images to 200K classes

The aim of joining the competition with such a immense dataset (~500GB of images) is to train myself how to handle large dataset, but not to win the competition under the limitation of GPU resources.

Browsing through different GPU resources providers, GCP was the best option
1) AWS (expensive)
2) vast.ai (cheap but hard to set up)
3) Paperpace (intermediate price)
4) Google cloud platform (intermediate price, easy to set up, free credits)

Downloading the dataset already took me 30 hours! 
Although the missing data is tiny compared 5M images, some landmark labels only appear once/twice for certain images.
So, lots of work were put on cleaning the dataset, finding missing images and downloading the missing data

The final score of the predictions gave me top 30% among all global teams
