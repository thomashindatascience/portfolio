# Kaggle-Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-disaster
To predict the survivors based on the guests' data

First, the usual data exploration approach
1) Cleaning the data & dealing with missing variables
2) Visualization of feature relations
3) Feature engineering

Two modelling approaches were applied on  training and predictions
1) fastai - tabular learner model
2) Stacking models 
   i - Random Forest Classifier
   ii - Extra Trees classifier
   iii - AdaBoost classifier
   iv - Gradient Boosting classifer
   v - support vector machine

The rank is on the top 10% among 10945 teams on the leaderboard
